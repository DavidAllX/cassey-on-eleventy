<p>I've recently discovered a love of poetry. There is so much richness to discover! The poems I read now are nothing like what I read in school; these poems speak to me, speak to my own experience as a woman or the experiences of marginalized groups, speak to relationships both tender and terrible. </p>

<p>I've discovered new-to-me poems through a poetry class I'm taking at the South of Downtown Art Hub, through <a href="https://slowdownshow.org">The Slowdown Show</a>, a five minute poem-a-day podcast released every weekday, through buying books of poems, and browsing slam poetry on YouTube.</p>

<p>Here are a few of my favorite poems, in no particular order.</p>

                {{/if}}
                <a href="{{this.url}}"><b>{{this.name}}</b> by {{this.author}}</a></p>
            <p>
                {{#if this.slowdownUrl}}
                    <a href="{{this.slowdownUrl}}">Listen on the Slowdown Show</a>

            </p>

    {{/each}}
</ul>
