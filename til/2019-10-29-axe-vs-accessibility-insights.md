title: 'Accessibility Insights runs a subset of rules from Axe'

My a11y learning for the week, after playing with Axe a bit over the last few weeks, is that the Accessibility Insights extension only runs a subset of the rules that axe-core has. This means the audit I did recently on the site I work on wasnâ€™t as thorough as I would have liked, and some minor issues remain that we'll have to address if we want to use Axe for automated accessibility testing.
