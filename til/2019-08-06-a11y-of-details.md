A coworker & I were talking about the `<details>` element and I had a hard time finding up to date info on how well supported it is by assistive technology. I asked around and my friend Michael Fairchild ended up [running a test for it](https://a11ysupport.io/tests/tech__html__details-summary) to add to [his website, a11ysupport.io](a11ysupport.io).
  
I learned: Dragon Naturally Speaking doesnâ€™t support opening a details element by voice, Narrator (built-in in Windows screenreader) support is very limited and other screenreaders have a few shortcomings in various places. No screenreader can make the element work in Internet Explorer, since the `<details>` element isn't supported by that browser at all.
