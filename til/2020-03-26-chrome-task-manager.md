Today I remembered Chrome has its own task manager, which is another tool to help decide why my laptop fans are on, and if any sites that I am responsible for building are the culprit. (They were not - now I know!)

You can get to it by going to the settings menu (3 dots, probably to the right of your address bar), opening 'More Tools' and selecting Task Manager.
