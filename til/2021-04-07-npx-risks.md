The other day when I went to add a post to [my TIL blog](https://cassey.dev/til), I got a scary error message. The site runs using the static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), but I got a warning when I tried to start up the site that the command I had just run was not the static site generator at all.

    alt="a screenshot of console output from the command 'npx eleventy --serve', with a message below that reads 'Atencion! This package has nothing to do with the eleventy static site generator. Most likely, you wanted to install the @11ty/eleventy package instead of this. Atencion! command not found: eleventy'"
  />

Instead, it seemed I had run a package called [eleventy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy) that is completely unaffiliated with the static site generator, which is listed on NPM as [@11ty/eleventy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@11ty/eleventy). 

## How did this happen? 

My package.json used `npx eleventy` in its build/start scripts, when it should have used `npx @11ty/eleventy` as specified in the [usage docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/usage/). You can [see the changes on GitHub](https://github.com/clottman/cassey-on-eleventy/commit/4c923bf1baca122159db17bafbd251fd0c264924#diff-7ae45ad102eab3b6d7e7896acd08c427a9b25b346470d7bc6507b6481575d519).

`npx eleventy` was being used from the very first commit to my site, which I re-wrote in Eleventy in June of 2019. I had never encountered issues before, and none of the packages involved had changed names recently.

## Okay, so why does this work most of the time?

Usually, when I'm setting up to run an Eleventy project in a new workspace, I run `npm install`, then `npm start`. If you've forgotten to run `npm install`, and also don't have Eleventy installed globally on your system, you might see that `npx eleventy` will try to use the wrong package.

## But why??

To understand what happened, we need to look at how `npx` works. The [readme for npx](https://github.com/npm/npx#readme) was really helpful for me here. 

`npx` tries to find a command name in $PATH (so, globally installed modules), or in local project binaries, which means specifically, in an entry at the key `bin` in `package.json`. The commad name defined in `bin` doesn't need to match the package name. For example, the package `@11ty/eleventy` has one command defined, that's just called `eleventy`. If you call `npx` using the name of a package, `npx` will try to guess which command from that package you want - so if you do `npx @11ty/eleventy`, it will guess that you mean to run the one command that's defined, `eleventy`. 

So, if you've already installed `@11ty/eleventy` locally or globally, you can run `npx eleventy` and get the version on your machine - a nice JavaScript static site generator. 

If you don't have the static site generator installed locally or globally, and you run `npx eleventy`, `npx` will look to the NPM registry and try to find a package there matching the name you entered - just `eleventy`. It will pull down the package and try to run a command defined in it, and at least currently, find that there is no command for it to run. The package `eleventy` has a postinstall script that runs, warning you that you just installed a package that is not the popular static site generator.

## So what do I do?

If you're using `npx eleventy` in your build/run scripts or directly on the command line, update those to be `npx @11ty/eleventy` to make sure you don't accidentally fetch and execute the entirely wrong package. 

It also seems like a good idea more generally when using `npx` to prefer using the fully qualified package name when you can, instead of the command name from `bin`. If there is just one `bin` command defined or the name of the command you want matches the package name, this should work. This way, you can avoid being surprised by a command that executes code you didn't actually mean to even download, let alone run.
