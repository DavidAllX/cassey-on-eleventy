I learned from [Dan Abramov's latest post](https://overreacted.io/how-are-function-components-different-from-classes/) about how class components are different than function components in React. It has to do with how `this` works in a class. I don't think we have many cases where it would matter in the Glitch community site, but it's good to know about!
