Sometimes I'm doing stuff in the terminal and realize whatever I need to do next would be easier in Finder - maybe dragging around a selection of files or folders. But how do I get to the exact place I am in the terminal, in Finder? 

The answer is: run `open .` in the terminal. `.` represents the current directory, `open` opens a finder window at that location.
