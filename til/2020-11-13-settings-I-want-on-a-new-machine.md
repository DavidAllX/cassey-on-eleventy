On a new machine, I want to [turn off the pager for git commands](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6986231). 

It'd be nice if this was saved in some sort of dotfile that I maintained - I used to have a set that I moved from machine to machine, but they're out of date now. 

I also want to [stop empty folders from collapsing in VS Code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59415299/vscode-disable-empty-folders-merge-collapse).
