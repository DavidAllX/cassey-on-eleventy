Found this [article on why remote meetings suck](https://chelseatroy.com/2018/03/29/why-do-remote-meetings-suck-so-much/) through a link provided in the Glitch D&I training, and it makes SO MUCH SENSE. And outlines the problems with traditional meetings in general, but especially remote meetings, in a way I hadn't encountered before. 

"The caucus problem" is a new concept to me but very helpful in explaining why meetings are hard sometimes.
