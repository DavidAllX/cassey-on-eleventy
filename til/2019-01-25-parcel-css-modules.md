title: Parcel Doesn't Support CSS Modules Without Config

Learning: Parcel seems like it supports CSS Modules out of the box, but it doesn't. :( I was confused about the documentation but figured it out after tracking down a couple closed github issues. I [documented what was confusing about the docs](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/70).
