One non-code thing I'm learning lately is that the levers of power are more obscured than I thought, even for local issues here in Lincoln, Nebraska. For example, I'm speaking today at a candidate forum jointly held by two local business groups which I assume are influential based on the name. Neither of them have much of an online presence though and there's no Facebook event I can find for the forum. So I guess it's invite-only if you're the kind of person they want to invite?
