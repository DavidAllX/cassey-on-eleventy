This isn't a "Today I learned" so much as "today I remembered that more people should know this".

In accessibility testing I’ve done lately on various pages, a common issue is that folks are using `<aside>` when it’s not appropriate. Basically, if you’re inside `<main>`, you can’t use `<aside>`. (Maybe you want `<section>` instead?)

It’s kind of counter-intuitive, because you’d think you could do, say, `<article>` and `<aside>` side-by-side. But unless your `<aside>` is outside `<main>`, you shouldn’t.
