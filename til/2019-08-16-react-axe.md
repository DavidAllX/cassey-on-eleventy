I just learned about [react-axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/react-axe), which runs while youâ€™re developing and highlights the kinds of errors in the rendered DOM that browser extensions like [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) (which I usually use) or the [Axe browser extension](https://www.deque.com/axe/) also detect automatically. It displays the results in the dev tools, similar to how prop validation errors are displayed in the dev tools when you're running in development mode.

It seems like a nice way to surface errors without everyone needing to run the browser extension each time they submit a PR.
