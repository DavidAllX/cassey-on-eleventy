It's been a pretty nice last few weeks for me, all things considered. Here are some things recently that have brought me joy. 

## Music

I got to see [Spencer LaJoye](https://www.spencerlajoye.com/) in concert. Spencer performed at the campus ministry church I was deeply invested in in college, but the show was open to the public. To be honest, I had not heard of Spencer LaJoye before learning about the upcoming show, but I checked them out and have been listening to their music around the clock basically for a week or so now. The show was so wonderful. I was fascinated by [this profile of Spencer in Religion News Service](https://religionnews.com/2023/06/29/a-prophetic-force-queer-songwriter-spencer-lajoye-finds-resonance-outside-religion/).

Previously in my life, it's been rare for listening to music to feel like a spiritual experience. (Notable exceptions include the Taizé monastery in France & Taizé style worship music, and honestly, all the music at the campus ministry I attended in college). But when I get the chance to hear queer people like [Adeem the Artist](https://www.adeemtheartist.com) or Spencer LaJoye perform live, I feel so clearly in the presence of what is holy and good. 

Speaking of queer music, Orville Peck and Willie Nelson released a collaboration/music video for a new rendition of ["Cowboys are Secretly Fond of Each Other"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BirJMnMcfBs), a classic Willie Nelson song. I love it. 

A not-queer (.. I think?) musical group that I've been digging lately is the Swedish group [Movits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LshiKYPERUo), who I'd never encountered til a friend mentioned them recently. They are so different than the other stuff I listen to most of the time! The way I described my first listens was: "This feels like it makes the wrinkly parts of my brain unfurl in a very pleasant way."

An album I think you should check out if you like folk music: ["Songs Not Bombs Vol. 2"](https://songsnotbombs.bandcamp.com/album/songs-not-bombs-vol-2), by a collection of artists who each donated an orignial song to the album. 100% of proceeds from all sales are being donated to the Palestinian Children's Relief Fund. 

## Other Media

I just re-read Becky Chambers' _A Psalm for the Wild-Built_ in preparation for a book club. It was as lovely as it was the first time around, a few years ago. It's very short, and portrays an actually utopian (not utopian, but horrific under the surface), post-capitalist and post-consumerist alternate future for an Earth-like planet. It was so cool how skillfully the author builds the world so vividly and quickly.

I watched Hannah Gadsby's "Gender Agenda" comedy special on Netflix. It was delightful. More queer people making funny jokes about queerness (and everything else), please!

My friend [John Jasa](https://www.youtube.com/@johnjasa) makes very funny videos and posts them on youtube and instagram. Check out the Shorts (or Reels) ranking various things belonging to John, as well as [this review of a book about cats that do art](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YL5yqNwdKdg). 

I am not very into podcasts, but came across the Money With Katie blog and read a ton of posts from its archive the other night. I thought the advice was generally sound, and Katie's overall approach (we need systemic change to make people's lives less financially precarious, _and_ in the meantime, there are some individual-level finance things that it can be helpful to know about or think through) was fairly values-aligned with where I'm at these days. I bookmarked [don't live beyond your assets, on avoiding lifestyle creep](https://moneywithkatie.com/blog/a-rule-for-avoiding-lifestyle-creep-dont-live-beyond-your-assets); the [feeling bad for the Joneses economy](https://moneywithkatie.com/blog/the-feeling-bad-for-the-joneses-economy), which pointed out that a statistic I was fairly familiar with (US average household income) is a bit misleading as it includes retirees only receiving defined benefit income, rather than my incorrect assumption that it was the average for households where all adults were working; and one titled ["Consumerism is exhausting: the choresumption phenomenon"](https://moneywithkatie.com/blog/consumerism-is-exhausting-choresumption). But there were so many more that were good, too! 

This [blog post on Spanish tips you maybe didn't learn from your Spanish teacher](https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/things-your-spanish-teacher-didnt-tell-you/) is a great resource. I knew some of this, but not all, and a lot of it I'd already forgotten since I learned it! 

## Other stuff

I got some [blue mascara](https://www.ulta.com/p/lash-sensational-sky-high-mascara-pimprod2020260?sku=2617938) and have been wearing it whenever it seems to plausibly match with my outfit or how I want to present for where I'm headed. I don't normally wear makeup, but it's so blue! 

This [site selling letterpress artwork](https://www.countrycounterculture.com/tender-heartpress) recently linked in Mariame Kaba's newsletter has so many gorgeous pieces.

This [reflection on poetry and Ellie Black's "Be Spiritual No More Mechanical"](https://ordinaryplots.substack.com/p/ellie-blacks-be-spiritual-no-more) was beautiful, as is the poem it discusses.
