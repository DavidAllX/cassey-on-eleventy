## Theory
- [Everyone Should Blog, and That Includes You](https://library.xandra.cc/everyone-should-blog/), a manifesto.

## Blogging Hosts
- [Write.as](https://write.as/) paid blog host, streamlined & focused on just letting you put words on the internet.
- [Pika Page](https://pika.page) also paid, a little more customizable than write.as. Focused on the writing!
- [mmm.page](https://mmm.page) - single page, drag & drop website builder that is trying to break the mold for what a webpage is supposed to look like. Click the hamburger menu icon and click 'explore' to see random creations people have made.
- [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) for short-form blogging.
- You can publish [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) pages on the web. 

### If you can code:
You can build a static site using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) (or Jekyll I guess), write posts in Markdown, and host it for free on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

The easiest way I know to get started with Eleventy is cloning [Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog). There's even a [one-click install](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) that connects it to Netlify! It will get you started quickly, but you can customize it to your heart's content.

Check out all [my Eleventy blogs I've written](https://www.cassey.dev/blog/tags/eleventy/) - pieces of possible interest:
- [Getting your bearings in an existing Eleventy project](https://www.cassey.dev/navigating-11ty-projects/): what's all the stuff in 11ty base blog doing?
- [Just Enough JavaScript for Eleventy](https://www.cassey.dev/just-enough-javascript-11ty/)
- [Converting a simple HTML site for Eleventy](https://www.cassey.dev/converting-an-html-file-to-eleventy/): if you already have a single page HTML/CSS site you want to start using 11ty on, for templating of your header and footer or to add more pages or a blog.
- [Using Decap CMS](https://www.cassey.dev/adding-decap-cms-to-11ty/): a free & relatively straightforward way to add a hosted frontend so you can publish posts from your phone or a computer where you don't have your full git setup.
