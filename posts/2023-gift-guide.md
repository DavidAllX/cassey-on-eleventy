Despite my best efforts to embrace a less consumerist lifestyle (a constant work in progress).. I have a deep love for holiday gift guides and product recommendations posts from real people. I read them wherever I can find them. Maybe you like them, too?

None of these are affiliate links or sponsored in any way. Some of these things I have or have tried; others I haven't. I try to note which one it is when it seems like it matters!

## Home Goods

- [Virginia Sole-Smith](https://virginiasolesmith.substack.com/) put [these mini stoneware bowls](https://www.eastfork.com/products/bitty-bowl-4-pack?variant=40712770027599) on her gift guide and I agree with her that they would make an awesome gift, though I do not have them myself. 

- [These colorful baking dishes/pans](https://greatjonesgoods.com/) - I don't have them and so have no idea how they'll hold up, but aren't they fun?? 

- The [Aura digital photo frames](https://auraframes.com/) are pricy but SO NICE. My whole family has them basically, and so we can add pictures to all the family frames at once. (Well actually we use a Google Photos album for pics of my kid, that is connected to each frame, so for us it's even simpler!) It makes me so dang happy to see the pictures scroll by. 

- I am a sucker for anything [Rifle Paper Co](https://riflepaperco.com/) designs. 

## Cool bags
- [These big funky totes](https://mokuyobi.com/products/keyboard-jam-perfect-tote). I am an admirer but don't have one, though I've had a few shirts from this brand!

- [This eggie toast bag](https://mokuyobi.com/collections/new/products/eggie-toast-bag) for your quirky friend. 

- [This duffel bag](https://www.thenorthface.com/en-us/bags-and-gear/luggage-and-duffels/duffel-bags-c224547/base-camp-duffell-pNF0A52SB?color=ZV1&size=OS) looks nice and sturdy.

- [Basically any bag Cotopaxi sells](https://www.cotopaxi.com/collections/bestselling-packs). 

- The [Baggu duck bags](https://www.baggu.com/collections/totes) are so nice and sturdy. Note they come in horizontal and vertical styles, with and without zippers. I do wish they came in more fun colors - see the other links for what usually draws my eye; if you clicked those and were horrified and wondering "where's the neutrals??", this might be the link for you. 

## Cookbooks & Home-Books

- [_Start Here_ by Sohla El-Waylly](https://bookshop.org/p/books/start-here-instructions-for-becoming-a-better-cook-a-cookbook-sohla-el-waylly/19782155) is a new one I'm really excited about (but haven't dug into yet). 

- [_I Dream of Dinner_ by Ali Slagle](https://bookshop.org/p/books/i-dream-of-dinner-so-you-don-t-have-to-low-effort-high-reward-recipes-a-cookbook-ali-slagle/16979880?ean=9780593232514) is the best new cookbook I've had in the last couple years. I love everything I've tried from it, and I love that the dinners are full of interesting flavor combinations but still feel pretty approachable (to my not-particularly-refined palate). And I especially love that there are lots of substitution suggestions so I can work with what I have on hand. 

- [_Snacking Cakes_ by Yossy Arefi](https://bookshop.org/p/books/snacking-cakes-simple-treats-for-anytime-cravings-a-baking-book-yossy-arefi/14351154) IS SO GOOD. Simple, one-bowl cakes you can make in under an hour (including washing up!) Built around the thesis that cake is great and we should all be eating it more. I AGREE. This book has a slightly cult following for a reason, people!! 

- [_Safe and Sound: A Renter-Friendly Guide to Home Repair_ by Mercury Stardust](https://bookshop.org/p/books/safe-sound-a-renter-friendly-guide-to-home-repair-mercury-stardust/18987499?ean=9780744079074&listref=bookshop-org-best-sellers-of-the-week) is a great book that I've read basically cover-to-cover, though it's probably more commonly used as a reference for various projects. I learned a lot, and appreciated Mercury's little pep talks scattered throughout the book, as someone who's pretty nervous about home repair-type stuff. 

- [_How Your House Works: A Visual Guide to Understanding and Maintaining Your Home_ by Charlie Wing](https://bookshop.org/p/books/how-your-house-works-a-visual-guide-to-understanding-and-maintaining-your-home-charlie-wing/12584985) is a great housewarming gift for a new homeowner. It shows you how the various systems/appliances/etc in your house work, so you can be more empowered to seek repairs as needed or troubleshoot issues. 

## For your activist/organizer friend

- [Prints from Radical Emprints](https://www.radicalemprints.com/shopstore)

- [A Black Lives Matter holiday sweater](https://www.the-outrage.com/products/black-lives-matter-ugly-sweater) to get some conversations going at Christmas dinner. 

- [Pro-trans & queer temporary tatoos](https://www.the-outrage.com/products/lgbtqia-temporary-tattoos) or [the same designs as stickers](https://www.the-outrage.com/products/lgbtqia-sticker-pack). I wish I had a million of these to take to family-friendly queer community events!

- [Mushroom sticker that says "You cannot destroy us in a way that matters](https://madeinomaha.com/product/katie-nieland-mushroom-sticker/), designed by Katie Nieland. (Get the whole [nature goes hard sticker pack](https://katienielandart.bigcartel.com/product/nature-goes-hard-sticker-pack) here)

## For your friends who bike

- [A shock-absorbing bike cup holder](https://handlestash.com/collections/handlestash-shock-absorbing-cup-holder/products/handlestash-shock-absorbing-cup-holder) which I don't have but I wish I did; I have a real gap right now in my ability to go get a tasty beverage somewhere and then bike to a new location with it! Alternately, a tight-sealing thermos of some kind. 

- The [bike bags from Po Campo](https://www.pocampo.com/) are nice and sturdy and don't need any special hardware or tools to attach. 

## For your friend who really likes birds

- [Liz Clayton Fuller's shop](https://lizclaytonfuller.com/pages/shop) has lots of pretty watercolor bird prints, stickers, and cards.

- [Bird Collective](https://www.birdcollective.com/) has ornaments, hats, shirts, blankets, books... so many different things with birds on them! 
- the [backyard birding flashcards](https://www.birdcollective.com/products/sibley-backyard-birding-flashcards-revised-and-updated) are a nice way to learn your birds!

- [This talking birdsong book](https://cornelllabpgstore.com/product/the-backyard-birdsongs-guide-eastern-central-north-america/) to learn to identify birds by their sounds - while having some (probably much needed) no-screens time. 


## For your Nebraskan friend

- Check out the [Made in Omaha](https://madeinomaha.com/) store (online shipping or brick & mortar locations in Omaha). This [pride shirt](https://madeinomaha.com/product/nebraska-pride-t-shirt/) is cute, as is this [more than corn](https://madeinomaha.com/product/omaha-screen-co-more-than-corn-t-shirt/) design showing native plants. They also have some items designed by [Lincoln artist Katie Nieland](https://madeinomaha.com/?s=katie). 

- Even more stuff direct from [Katie Nieland](https://katienielandart.bigcartel.com/) - art, stickers, shirts, and even a locally-themed coloring book! 

- [The state of Nebraska as a progress pride flag shirt](https://www.raygunsite.com/products/nebraska-outline-progress-pride-flag) from Raygun. 

- ["The People's House" NE State Capitol shirt](https://shirts101.store/nebraska_appleseed/shop/product-detail/1015433) benefitting Nebraska Appleseed. 

- Cool [metal wall art Nebraska](https://www.metalpetalart.com/collections/wall-sculpture-1/products/nebraska-wall-sculpture)

## Clothes

- Do you know someone who needs a really [fancy going out caftan](https://fringe-co.com/collections/caftans)? Is it you? Maybe it's me. Who knows. 

- [Big Bud Press](https://bigbudpress.com) has lots of cool stuff. 


## Queer Stuff (that's not already in another category)

- Find their flag on seemingly any kind of product at [Nerdy Keppie](https://nerdykeppie.com/).
- The [best rainbow stripe tee](https://www.primary.com/products/grown-ups-tee-in-double-rainbow-stripe) you can currently buy for adult sizes is hiding at Primary.com which mainly does kid clothes!

## Kid Stuff

I should probably do a whole separate post on these but here's a few things! (Including more lists, sorry/notsorry)

- ["The Kids Should See This"](https://tksstgiftguide.tumblr.com/) has so many cool ideas, I want them all, but for me? For the kid I wish I had been? 
- I love, love, love the [Busy Toddler Gift Guides](https://busytoddler.com/category/gift-guide/) and the ethos behind what gets included. 
- [This "Be brave, curious, and kind" pennant](https://oxfordpennant.com/products/be-brave-dustin-black-oxford-pennant/)
- [Maisonette](https://www.maisonette.com/shop/play/kids?product_type=Costumes) sells a ton of really cool-seeming toys but especially has a really good selection of dress-up clothes & costumes. 
- Anything from [Primary.com](https://primary.com) for kid clothes. (Or the grown-up rainbow stripe tee shirt; I'm wearing mine now!)
- I have seen 500 million discussions on whether one should buy a Yoto Player or a Toniebox for a young child and I will save you (but probably it's too late) from all the effort and just tell you I am leaning towards Yoto Mini for my kid.
