A worldwide coronavirus pandemic is going on. A few poems have really resonated with people around me during this time. Here they are:

- ["Pandemic" by Lynn Ungar](http://www.lynnungar.com/poems/pandemic/)
- ["Wash Your Hands" by Dori Midnight](https://dorimidnight.com/uncategorized/wash-your-hands/)
- ["Lockdown" by Richard Hendrick](https://www.irishcentral.com/culture/coronavirus-lockdown-poem)
- ["Once the World was Perfect" by Joy Harjo](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/141846/once-the-world-was-perfect). Seen on Facebook on March 24.
- ["When people say, 'we have made it through worse before'" by Clint Smith](https://poems.com/poem/when-people-say-we-have-made-it-through-worse-before/) Seen on Twitter sometime the last week of March

On Thursday I will be hosting a Zoom meetup for some friends to talk about poetry for 40 minutes, the time limit of the Zoom free tier. I wonder if someone will bring one of these poems?
