In my household, we use the app Paprika 3 (available on Android or iOS) for managing grocery lists & meal planning. It is vastly superior to our old methods of a Google Keep grocery list + an Airtable we could have meal planned with but never did!

I like that it is a one-time app purchase for each device (for example, $5 for my partner on her phone, and $5 for me), and not a recurring subscription.

Today I noticed that you can add separate lists in the Grocery section. I made one called "Target" and another one called "Hardware Store" and now we can keep track of things that are outside our usual grocery store trip scope, but need to be remembered so that when we go to Target or the hardware store, we can remember all the stuff we have been meaning to get at those places!
