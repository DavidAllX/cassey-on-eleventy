Light & cozy reading suggestions are a frequent request in the Women in Tech slack I'm in.

Here are a few that have come up a lot, so we can link this post when someone asks again! 

- _Legends & Lattes_, and it's sequel, _Bookshops and Bonedust_
- _House on the Cerulean Sea_
- _Psalm for the Wild-Built_ and its sequel, _Prayer for the Crown Shy_.
    - These are novellas featuring a nonbinary monk in a utopian future, looking for meaning and finding friendship
    - Anything by Becky Chambers really goes on this list, too. _A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet_ is about a lovable alien space ship crew having decently low stakes adventures. The whole series is great, though note the second is a little sadder (themes of grief and self-identity, and child slave labor). They are all in the same universe but standalone, so you could easily skip #2.
- _The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches_ 
- _The Ex Hex_ and its sequel, _The Kiss Curse_
- Jasmine Guillory - easy romances
- Murderbot series by Martha Wells. 
    - A series about a genderless AI robot built to be a security guard, who gains self-control and mostly wants to use it to watch soap operas in their head, but keeps discovering the power of real life friendship anyways
- _Killers of a Certain Age_, a super fun spy novel about these 4 best friends who became contract killers ("bad guys" only, ofc) together as young women, who have just reached retirement but get pulled into one last big job. Very funny.
- _Little Paris Bookshop_
- _The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake_ "was weird but you might like it" 
- Anything by Alexander McCall Smith
- _Shady Hollow_ by Juneau Black - cosy murder mystery but everyone's an animal
- _The Cat Who Saved Books_ by Sosuke Natsukawa
- "If you're ok with the initial murder premise, I really like the cozies by Abby Collette, Valerie Burns, and Jesse Q. Sutanto. All three have some found family themes, which I love."
    - "(Especially Vera Wong's Unsolicited Advice for Murderers - it was so so great.)"
- Alexis Hall: _Boyfriend Material_ and _Rosaline Palmer Takes the Cake_
- _Battle Royal_ by Lucy Parker
- _The Library of Lost and Found_ by Phaedra Patrick

## Nonfiction
- books by James Herriot, a British vet who tells British countryside vet stories
- _Other Minds_, a bit more cerebral, about how cephalopod (think squid) brains work and how smart they are in a physiologically entirely different way than humans
- _The Genius of Birds_, continuing on the smart animal theme, on the different ways that birds are actually super smart
- _Dancing in the Streets: A History of Collective Joy_
- The Art of Gathering by Priya Parker, on considerations and approaches to having really meaningful and fun get togethers from work retreats to dinner parties to whatever
