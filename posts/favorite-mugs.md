These are my old reliables. I believe they are both from Wal-Mart, and I got at least the first one for my college dorm. They are what I reach for most office if either one is clean... or even sometimes if they're not, just give them a good rinse and go again. I like the thick walls of the mug, and they're a good size: plenty big, but not unwieldy.

This mug is another favorite. It was gifted to me as a surprise by a product manager at a company I worked for, after a hard project we worked on together. I'm not usually a "cover all my stuff in cat iconography" person, but I do really like this mug. It's tasteful cat-lady. I can get behind that.

This logo I got from my time working at Glitch. It's a bit bigger than the others, and has nice thick walls like the red & blue ones. It feels sturdy.
