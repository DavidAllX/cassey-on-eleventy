Several years ago we converted the lawn in front of my house to a native plant meadow-style garden. My spouse and I have learned so much along the way that I should definitely write up sometime, but for right now, here's a list of some resources that I have found helpful. I'm based in Lincoln, Nebraska, so these resources will probably be most relevant to you if you're in this rough region.

## Books

I've spent a lot of time with various books on native plants, to learn to identify the things we're growing as well as to decide what else to add to the yard.

"Native Plants of the Midwest" is the book I'd recommend if you were hoping to add more native plants to your yard and you only want to get one book. (But why would you get just one book?)

This field guide is my favorite for flipping through and seeing a photo and quick description of each plant, to get better at identifying native plants I've planted, that my neighbors have planted, or that I see on walks at sites like [Spring Creek Prairie Audobon Center](https://springcreek.audubon.org/).

"Common Backyard Weeds of the Upper Midwest" is super useful for identifying common weeds you'll run into and management strategies for them. There's a lot of "did I plant this or is this a weed" in my native plant journey so far.

Okay,
