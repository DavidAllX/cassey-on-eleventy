I have been wanting to (re)learn to sew, and specifically to sew my own clothing, which I have never done before. I have a machine that I claimed from my mom, but haven't used it in years. 

In middle school or so, I learned to sew at my neighbor's kitchen table. She had been a home economics teacher for many years and an extension educator, but our school no longer had home ec, and I was not in 4-H where the sewing classes were advertised. So I would carry my mom's machine next door to her house, and she taught me to sew and press. I made a little bag and a pillow. It was nice!

Later, my grandmother helped me make a quilt top in a nice log cabin pattern. When we were picking out the fabric, she said to wait to buy the backing and batting until I had finished the top. It was a Quilt-in-a-Day pattern, and I did indeed finish the top in a single weekend! It is still just a top, however, because I never did make it back to the store for the backing and batting.
