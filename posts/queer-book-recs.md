A short(ish) list of queer books I've read & enjoyed over the last couple years. None of these are affiliate links. (read: I'm not making money on this)

## Fiction
- [_Detransition, Baby_](https://bookshop.org/books/detransition-baby/9780593133385) is so, so good. A detransitioned person knocks up their cis straight boss, and proposes that they raise the baby together (all 3) with their ex-girlfriend, a trans woman desperate to become a mother. 
- [_A Lady for a Duke_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/a-lady-for-a-duke/18934989) by Alexis Hall is a wonderful historical romance set in what I believe is Regency England. The protagonist was assumed dead in a war and used the opportunity to return to society as the woman she'd always known she was. But her dear friend the duke is so sad about losing his friend. A meddling sister-in-law brings the two back together and romance ensues.
- [_Honey Girl_](https://bookshop.org/books/honey-girl-9780778311027/9780778311027) is a fun romance with a nonwhite main character trying to figure out her life after finally graduating with her PhD.
- [_Cemetery Boys_](https://bookshop.org/books/cemetery-boys-9781432889265/9781250250469) is about a trans Latinx teenager who summons a ghost, it's YA and really nice. 
- [_Red, White, and Royal Blue_](https://bookshop.org/books/red-white-royal-blue/9781250316776) is a fun M/M romance; the biracial son of the divorced first woman president of the US falls for the British queen's grandson. Especially good if you're into politics at all.
- [_One Last Stop_](https://bookshop.org/books/one-last-stop/9781250244499) is from the same author as the Red White & Royal Blue but it's pretty different - a woman falls in love with a woman she meets on the subway; time travel is involved.
- [_Outlawed_](https://bookshop.org/books/outlawed-9781635575422/9781635575422) by Anna North and [_Upright Women Wanted_](https://bookshop.org/books/upright-women-wanted/9781250213587) by Sarah Gailey are both feminist, queer-adjacent westerns - UWW has a more explicitly queer main character but I think I preferred Outlawed. Both fun, though.
- [_This is How You Lose the Time War_](https://bookshop.org/books/this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war/9781534430990) is lyrical and beautiful. Time traveling spies on opposite sides of a war fall in love via letters left on the battlefield. 
- [_Payback's a Witch_](https://bookshop.org/books/payback-s-a-witch/9780593336069) is a W/W romance where the main character returns to her magical hometown where she is part of a longstanding magical family, where she must officiate a high stakes competition where one of the competitors is her ex boyfriend she's ready to get revenge on. 
- [_A Psalm for the Wild Built_](https://bookshop.org/books/a-psalm-for-the-wild-built/9781250236210) in which a a non-binary monk explores the meaning of life in a post-scarcity society. A short read in an immersive, peaceful word.
- [_Ancillary Justice_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/ancillary-justice-ann-leckie/110863) is a book about a robot/human construct person (or non-person, depending on who you ask), who is seeking possible revenge. Along the way, said person/non-person gets confused about human conceptions of gender a lot. It's fun.

## Nonfiction
- [_Ace: What Asexuality Reveals about Desire, Society, and the Meaning of Sex_](https://bookshop.org/books/ace-what-asexuality-reveals-about-desire-society-and-the-meaning-of-sex-9781662036811/9780807013793) gave me so much to think about. 
- [_Raising Them: Our adventure in gender creative parenting_](https://bookshop.org/books/raising-them-our-adventure-in-gender-creative-parenting/9781542003674) tells the story of a couple who chose to not assign a gender to their child at birth. Ultimately it's not what we decided to do for my baby, but it worked out pretty well for the author and was an interesting look at a subversive way of parenting. 
- [_Hijab Butch Blues_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/hijab-butch-blues-a-memoir-lamya-h/18490165) by Lamya H is a memoir of a queer hijabi Muslim immigrant from a childhood in a rich Arab country to the United States for college and adult life. It is so rich and the author's life narrative is so beautifully woven with feminist interpretations of stories from the Quran.
- [_Transgender History_](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/susan-stryker/transgender-history-second-edition/9781580056908/) by Susan Stryker is great. I [wrote some reflections inspired by _Transgender History_](\transgender-repro-lib). 
- [_Love Lives Here_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/566534/love-lives-here-by-rowan-jette-knox-formerly-amanda-jette-knox/) by Rowan Jette Knox is a memoir of someone (who viewed himself as a cis woman when published, now out as a trans man) whose kid transitioned, then his spouse did a year later. CW for intense and violent bullying descriptions from the author's childhood in the first half, and descriptions of navigating societal transphobia later on. 
- [This Arab is Queer](https://www.akpress.org/this-arab-is-queer.html) by Elias Jahshan (and many others; it's an anthology of short essays) is filled with heartfelt perspectives and great writing. 
- _Queer Conception_ by Kristen Liam Kali is a must-read if you are interested in making a baby and you want to do it alone, with multiple partners, or as part of a partnership that's not two straight cis people. Tons of great info on everything from preparing for pregnancy, options for making conception happen, and navigating the health care system.

## Visual Novels & Nonfiction
- _Queer: A Graphic History_ is a nice and quite approachable read on the development of queer theory. (Rather than like, a history of social movements or famous queer people.)
- _Gender Queer: A Memoir_ by Maia Kobabe is the one you've seen getting banned all over the place; it's a moving story of what it felt like for this particular genderqueer person to grow up and figure out identity. 
- _The Third Person_ by Emma Grove is a memoir about trauma and barriers to getting gender affirming care as a person with dissociative identity disorder. 

## Baby/Kids Books
There's some really cute baby books with cool representations of different kinds of families or people in them. Here's some I like: 

- [_Love Makes a Family_](https://bookshop.org/books/love-makes-a-family-9780525554226/9780525554226) is one of my favorites.
- [_Families Can_](https://bookshop.org/books/families-can/9780593223659) and [_Families Belong_](https://bookshop.org/books/families-belong/9780593222768) are two books from the same illustrator; they're lovely.
- [_It Feels Good To Be Yourself_](https://bookshop.org/books/it-feels-good-to-be-yourself-a-book-about-gender-identity/9781250302953) is really great for older (elementary aged maybe) kids. I gifted it to a family member to help her explain transness and non-binary-ness to her kids. 
- [_Bodies Are Cool_](https://bookshop.org/books/bodies-are-cool/9780593112625) is on my wishlist for my baby's collection. It highlights all the different kinds of bodies that are out there: different skin tones, shapes, hair types, etc.
