A short(ish) list of queer books I've read & enjoyed over the last couple years. None of these are affiliate links. (read: I'm not making money on this)

## Fiction
- [_Detransition, Baby_](https://bookshop.org/books/detransition-baby/9780593133385) is so, so good. A detransitioned person knocks up their cis straight boss, and proposes that they raise the baby together (all 3) with their ex-girlfriend, a trans woman desperate to become a mother. 
- [_A Lady for a Duke_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/a-lady-for-a-duke/18934989) by Alexis Hall is a wonderful historical romance set in what I believe is Regency England. The protagonist was assumed dead in a war and used the opportunity to return to society as the woman she'd always known she was. But her dear friend the duke is so sad about losing his friend. A meddling sister-in-law brings the two back together and romance ensues.
- [_Honey Girl_](https://bookshop.org/books/honey-girl-9780778311027/9780778311027) is a fun romance with a nonwhite main character trying to figure out her life after finally graduating with her PhD.
- [_Cemetery Boys_](https://bookshop.org/books/cemetery-boys-9781432889265/9781250250469) is about a trans Latinx teenager who summons a ghost, it's YA and really nice. 
- [_Red, White, and Royal Blue_](https://bookshop.org/books/red-white-royal-blue/9781250316776) is a fun M/M romance; the biracial son of the divorced first woman president of the US falls for the British queen's grandson. Especially good if you're into politics at all.
- [_One Last Stop_](https://bookshop.org/books/one-last-stop/9781250244499) is from the same author as the Red White & Royal Blue but it's pretty different - a woman falls in love with a woman she meets on the subway; time travel is involved.
- [_Outlawed_](https://bookshop.org/books/outlawed-9781635575422/9781635575422) by Anna North and [_Upright Women Wanted_](https://bookshop.org/books/upright-women-wanted/9781250213587) by Sarah Gailey are both feminist, queer-adjacent westerns - UWW has a more explicitly queer main character but I think I preferred Outlawed. Both fun, though.
- [_This is How You Lose the Time War_](https://bookshop.org/books/this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war/9781534430990) is lyrical and beautiful. Time traveling spies on opposite sides of a war fall in love via letters left on the battlefield. 
- [_Payback's a Witch_](https://bookshop.org/books/payback-s-a-witch/9780593336069) is a W/W romance where the main character returns to her magical hometown where she is part of a longstanding magical family, where she must officiate a high stakes competition where one of the competitors is her ex boyfriend she's ready to get revenge on. 
- [_A Psalm for the Wild Built_](https://bookshop.org/books/a-psalm-for-the-wild-built/9781250236210) in which a a non-binary monk explores the meaning of life in a post-scarcity society. A short read in an immersive, peaceful word.
- [_Ancillary Justice_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/ancillary-justice-ann-leckie/110863) is a book about a robot/human construct person (or non-person, depending on who you ask), who is seeking possible revenge. Along the way, said person/non-person gets confused about human conceptions of gender a lot. It's fun.

## Nonfiction
- [_Ace: What Asexuality Reveals about Desire, Society, and the Meaning of Sex_](https://bookshop.org/books/ace-what-asexuality-reveals-about-desire-society-and-the-meaning-of-sex-9781662036811/9780807013793) gave me so much to think about. 
- [_Raising Them: Our adventure in gender creative parenting_](https://bookshop.org/books/raising-them-our-adventure-in-gender-creative-parenting/9781542003674) tells the story of a couple who chose to not assign a gender to their child at birth. Ultimately it's not what we decided to do for my baby, but it worked out pretty well for the author and was an interesting look at a subversive way of parenting. 
- [_Hijab Butch Blues_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/hijab-butch-blues-a-memoir-lamya-h/18490165) by Lamya H is a memoir of a queer hijabi Muslim immigrant from a childhood in a rich Arab country to the United States for college and adult life. It is so rich and the author's life narrative is so beautifully woven with feminist interpretations of stories from the Quran.

## Baby/Kids Books

There's some really cute baby books with cool representations of different kinds of families or people in them. Here's some I like: 

- [_Love Makes a Family_](https://bookshop.org/books/love-makes-a-family-9780525554226/9780525554226) is one of my favorites.
- [_Families Can_](https://bookshop.org/books/families-can/9780593223659) and [_Families Belong_](https://bookshop.org/books/families-belong/9780593222768) are two books from the same illustrator; they're lovely.
- [_It Feels Good To Be Yourself_](https://bookshop.org/books/it-feels-good-to-be-yourself-a-book-about-gender-identity/9781250302953) is really great for older (elementary aged maybe) kids. I gifted it to a family member to help her explain transness and non-binary-ness to her kids. 
- [_Bodies Are Cool_](https://bookshop.org/books/bodies-are-cool/9780593112625) is on my wishlist for my baby's collection. It highlights all the different kinds of bodies that are out there: different skin tones, shapes, hair types, etc.
