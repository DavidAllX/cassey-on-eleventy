Let's make 2023 the Year of the Blog (again). 

Not sure where to get started? Here are some links you might find useful, to either get started building your own home on the web, or to find other places people are blogging or making niche and weird personal sites!

- [Everyone Should Blog, and That Includes You](https://library.xandra.cc/everyone-should-blog/) a manifesto. 
- [mmm.page](https://mmm.page/) - single page, drag & drop website builder that is trying to break the mold for what a webpage is supposed to look like. Click the hamburger menu icon and click ['explore'](https://mmm.page/explore) to see random creations people have made.
- [32-Bit Cafe Resource List for the Personal Web](https://discuss.32bit.cafe/wiki/resources)  - tons of links on how to get started making your own site or blogging. See also [the main 32-Bit Cafe](https://32bit.cafe/) site; 32-Bit Cafe is an online community for website hobbyists. 
- [Blogroll.org](https://blogroll.org/) a human-curated list of actively updating personal & independent blogs.
- [Indie Newsletters](https://indienewsletters.com/), a human-curated list of actively updating personal & independent email newsletters. From the maker of Blogroll!
- [Maggie Appleton's Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) has a ton of interesting stuff on it. Her [digital garden history & ethos](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) is great. If that idea intrigues you, but you aren't a programmer, check out [Digital Gardening for Non-Technical Folks](https://maggieappleton.com/nontechnical-gardening). There's also a [more complete resource list she maintains](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners).
