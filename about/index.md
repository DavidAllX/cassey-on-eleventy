Hi everyone. I'm a storyteller and poet.  

I create events that bring *good* people together to bridge meaningful connections. I've organized **91** events uplifting **337** storytellers to **5,621** people across **eight** states and online. My favorite series has been [Startup Storytellers](https://www.youtube.com/@startupstorytellers2280) which uplifted the *actual* journey of the entrepreneur; my fun way of demystifying it all to make the path to freedom more accessible. It's especially important to make this content available to our youth which is why I made a program for them called [*Leaders in Training - LIT*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwWSYYjmZoY).  


I created [Belly of the Beast Life Stories](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/davidall) to dive deeper into the *untold* stories among us -- the times when we're knocked down by an unwanted change and we stand up a new person -- and to examine the patterns coming up collectively in our stories. I've always considered this project a lifelong endeavor, a tugboat for my creativity, and a sacred platform for me to tell stories of personal transformation. I believe that the wisdom we earn along life's journey is often unrealized because we're rarely given a moment to hold the mic and answer the questions that take us there.
