I'm a web developer mainly working in full stack Ruby on Rails and static sites with Eleventy these days. I'm also a parent to a very cute kid, and a person fighting alongside my community to keep my home (Lincoln, Nebraska) a place I want to raise said kid. A place that's safe for all kinds of people to thrive.

A few years back, I [ran for City Council](https://web.archive.org/web/20190809135734/http://casseyforcouncil.com/) in Lincoln. I ran to draw attention to the importance of ensuring adequate and affordable housing for people of all income levels in Lincoln, and to be an advocate for neighborhoods that have been neglected by city officials for too long.
